# Everglades

Practiced using R by working with and revising an online Everglades example. 
Tinkered with the graphical design of boxplots and basic statistics (ANOVA).
The HAED data file from http://sofia.usgs.gov/exchange/desmond/desmondelev.html was used. 
The file contained collected data on surveying methods, elevation, habitat, and other associated information. 
Elevation and habitat were one set of variables compared.
